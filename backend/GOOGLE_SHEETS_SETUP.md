# Google Sheets Integration Setup Guide

This guide will help you set up automatic synchronization between your MongoDB database and Google Sheets.

## Prerequisites

1. **MongoDB Replica Set**: Change streams require a replica set (MongoDB Atlas provides this by default)
2. **Google Cloud Project**: You'll need a Google Cloud project with Sheets API enabled

## Step-by-Step Setup

### 1. Create Google Cloud Project & Enable API

1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Create a new project or select an existing one
3. Enable the **Google Sheets API**:
   - Go to "APIs & Services" > "Library"
   - Search for "Google Sheets API"
   - Click "Enable"

### 2. Create Service Account

1. Go to "APIs & Services" > "Credentials"
2. Click "Create Credentials" > "Service Account"
3. Fill in the service account details
4. Click "Create and Continue"
5. Skip role assignment (click "Continue")
6. Click "Done"

### 3. Generate Service Account Key

1. Click on the created service account
2. Go to "Keys" tab
3. Click "Add Key" > "Create New Key"
4. Choose "JSON" format
5. Download the JSON file

### 4. Create Google Sheet

1. Create a new Google Sheet
2. Copy the Sheet ID from the URL:
   ```
   https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/SHEET_ID_HERE/edit
   ```
3. Share the sheet with your service account email:
   - Click "Share"
   - Add the service account email (from the JSON file)
   - Give "Editor" permissions

### 5. Configure Environment Variables

Update your `backend/.env` file:

```env
# Google Sheets Configuration
GOOGLE_SHEETS_ENABLED=true
GOOGLE_SHEET_ID=your-actual-sheet-id-here
GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY={"type":"service_account",...your-full-json-here...}
```

**Important**: Replace the placeholder values with your actual credentials!

### 6. Run Setup Script

```bash
cd backend
npm run setup:sheets
```

This will:

- Test the connection to Google Sheets
- Add column headers to your sheet
- Verify the integration is working

## Features

### Automatic Sync

Once configured, the system will automatically:

- **Insert**: Add new rows when bookings are created
- **Update**: Modify existing rows when bookings are updated
- **Delete**: Remove rows when bookings are deleted

### Data Columns

The following data is synced to Google Sheets:

| Column               | Description                 |
| -------------------- | --------------------------- |
| Booking ID           | Unique booking identifier   |
| Customer ID          | Customer reference          |
| Service              | Primary service type        |
| Service Type         | Service category            |
| Services List        | All selected services       |
| Scheduled Date       | Pickup/service date         |
| Scheduled Time       | Pickup/service time         |
| Provider Name        | Service provider            |
| Address              | Service location            |
| Coordinates          | GPS coordinates             |
| Total Price          | Original price              |
| Discount Amount      | Applied discounts           |
| Final Amount         | Final price after discounts |
| Payment Status       | Payment state               |
| Status               | Booking status              |
| Special Instructions | Customer notes              |
| Created At           | Booking creation time       |
| Updated At           | Last update time            |

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Permission denied" errors**
   - Ensure the sheet is shared with the service account email
   - Check that the service account has "Editor" permissions

2. **"Sheet not found" errors**
   - Verify the GOOGLE_SHEET_ID is correct
   - Make sure the sheet exists and is accessible

3. **"API not enabled" errors**
   - Enable Google Sheets API in your Google Cloud project
   - Wait a few minutes for the API to be fully activated

4. **Change streams not working**
   - Ensure you're using MongoDB Atlas or a replica set
   - Check MongoDB connection logs

### Testing the Integration

1. **Manual Test**:

   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm run setup:sheets
   ```

2. **Live Test**:
   - Start the backend server
   - Create a new booking through the app
   - Check if it appears in Google Sheets

### Logs

Monitor the logs for integration status:

- `âœ… Google Sheets integration initialized successfully`
- `ðŸ“Š New booking added to Google Sheets: [booking-id]`
- `ðŸ‘‚ Listening to MongoDB changes for Google Sheets sync...`

## Security Notes

- Keep your service account credentials secure
- Don't commit the actual JSON key to version control
- Consider using environment-specific service accounts
- Regularly rotate service account keys

## Performance Considerations

- The integration uses MongoDB change streams for real-time updates
- Each operation makes an API call to Google Sheets
- Google Sheets API has rate limits (100 requests per 100 seconds per user)
- For high-volume applications, consider batching operations

## Support

If you encounter issues:

1. Check the server logs for error messages
2. Verify all environment variables are set correctly
3. Test the Google Sheets API connection manually
4. Ensure MongoDB change streams are working
