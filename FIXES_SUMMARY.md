# Booking System Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Address Type Dropdown

- **Problem**: Missing address type selection (home/office/other)
- **Solution**: Added address type dropdown in `EnhancedAddressForm.tsx`
- **Location**: Lines 872-884 in `src/components/EnhancedAddressForm.tsx`

### 2. ✅ Address Editing Functionality

- **Problem**: Users couldn't edit saved addresses
- **Solution**: Added edit functionality to `SavedAddressesModal.tsx`
- **Features**:
  - Edit button for each saved address
  - Edit address modal with pre-filled data
  - Update functionality with validation

### 3. ✅ Google Sheets CORS Issues

- **Problem**: Direct API calls to Google Sheets causing CORS errors
- **Solution**: Route Google Sheets requests through backend API
- **Changes**:
  - Modified `googleSheetsService.ts` to use `/api/sheets/save` endpoint
  - Added backend route in `backend/routes/google-sheets.js`
  - Fallback to direct call if backend unavailable

### 4. ✅ Removed Google Sheets Button from Booking History

- **Problem**: Unwanted Google Sheets integration button in booking history
- **Solution**: Removed `<GoogleSheetsInfo />` component from `EnhancedBookingHistory.tsx`
- **Location**: Line 588 in `src/components/EnhancedBookingHistory.tsx`

### 5. ✅ Booking Confirmation Flow

- **Problem**: "Empty cart" showing instead of "Booking confirmed"
- **Solution**: Added proper booking confirmation screen
- **Changes**:
  - Created new `BookingConfirmed.tsx` component
  - Added `booking-confirmed` view state to `LaundryIndex.tsx`
  - Updated checkout flow to show confirmation instead of redirecting to bookings
  - Stores booking data for confirmation display

### 6. ✅ Address Object Handling in Backend

- **Problem**: Address mixing error when object passed to backend
- **Solution**: Improved address sanitization in backend
- **Changes**:
  - Added address object to string conversion in `backend/routes/bookings.js`
  - Added `address_details` field to Booking model
  - Proper separation of string address and object details

### 7. ✅ Form Validation Improvements

- **Problem**: Missing validation for address type
- **Solution**: Added address type validation to `FormValidation.tsx`
- **Feature**: Validates that address type is selected from [home, office, other]

### 8. ✅ Booking Save and Display Issues

- **Problem**: Bookings not saving properly or not showing in history
- **Solution**: Improved booking creation flow
- **Changes**:
